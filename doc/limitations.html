        <p>
            The following are limitations for this version:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>&#x2022; Graphing<sup> *</sup></dt>
            <dd>Due to this project being in its very early stages, the main graphing feature is yet to be implemented, but is top priority.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>&#x2022; Limited operations<sup> *</sup></dt>
            <dd>Currently, the program only calculates basic arithmetic and exponentiation. Functions like <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>tan</code>, etc are planned to be implemented.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>&#x2022; Consecutive unary operations<sup> *</sup></dt>
            <dd>Any consecutive unary operations, <var>+</var> or <var>-</var>, in front of a number will be parsed incorrectly.<br />
                For example <code>1 + -1</code> will be parsed incorrectly since the consecutive <var>+</var> and <var>-</var> will be treated as single operators and not linked to the number following it.<br />
                To remedy this, for now, the above expression should be input as <code>1 + (-1)</code>
            </dd>

            <dt>&#x2022; Floating point precision</dt>
            <dd>Due to floating point errors, numbers with a large combined quantity of whole and fractional digits will not be properly calculated or flat out ignored.<br />
                There are no plans to fix or implement a better method for this.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p><sup>*</sup> <small>Planned to be added, fixed, or modified.</small></p>
